Here’s a **full, clean, straight-to-the-point description** of your **Bunnix App** exactly as it has evolved through every screen we designed — the complete concept from top to bottom.

I’ll make it **clear, structured, professional**, and suitable for use in documentation, pitching, UI planning, or developer handoff.

# **📱 BUNNIX — Full App Description**

Bunnix is a **dual-purpose marketplace and service-booking ecosystem**.
It brings **vendors and customers** into one app, letting people:

Everything is clean, modern, and consistent with the theme we’ve been building.
